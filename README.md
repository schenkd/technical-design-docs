## **Key Insights from Leading Tech Companies**

### **Google's Design Doc Philosophy**
- **Primary Focus:** Document trade-offs and design decisions, not just implementation details
- **Structure:** Context â†’ Goals/Non-Goals â†’ Design â†’ Trade-offs â†’ Alternatives
- **Length:** 10-20 pages for major projects, 1-3 pages for smaller ones
- **Process:** Write collaboratively, review widely, update during implementation

### **Amazon's 6-Pager Approach**
- **Data-Driven:** Use specific numbers, avoid vague terms like "many customers"
- **Problem-First:** Always start with the customer problem
- **No Bullet Points:** Use structured narrative format
- **Silent Reading:** Begin meetings with 15 minutes of silent document reading

### **Microsoft's PRD Structure**
- **Executive Summary** for all stakeholders
- **Competitive Analysis** to understand landscape
- **Clear Assumptions** and documented risks
- **Success Metrics** with measurable outcomes

### **Netflix's Documentation Strategy**
- **Problem Before Solution:** Frame the business problem first
- **Real Examples:** Use production examples, not toy cases
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Layer information for different skill levels
- **Failure Scenarios:** Document what can go wrong and how to handle it

### **Meta's Product Architecture Focus**
- **API-First Design:** Emphasize clean interfaces between components
- **Data Modeling:** Detailed attention to data structures and relationships
- **User-Centric:** Design APIs that make frontend development easier
- **Scalability:** Always consider how the design scales

## **Universal Best Practices Across All Companies**

### **Document Structure**
1. **Start with Why** - Business context and problem statement
2. **Define Boundaries** - Goals and explicit non-goals
3. **Show Your Work** - Design decisions and alternatives considered
4. **Address Cross-Cutting Concerns** - Security, performance, observability
5. **Plan for the Future** - Evolution and maintenance considerations

### **Writing Process**
1. **Research First** - Understand the problem space thoroughly
2. **Prototype When Needed** - Validate assumptions with code
3. **Focus on Trade-offs** - Document why you chose A over B
4. **Iterate with Feedback** - Share early and often for input
5. **Keep Current** - Update during implementation

### **Review and Collaboration**
- Use collaborative tools (Google Docs is preferred across companies)
- Start reviews with silent reading time
- Focus feedback on decisions and trade-offs, not formatting
- Include diverse perspectives in reviews
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good

## **When to Use Technical Design Documents**

### **Create a TDD When:**
- Project requires >2 weeks of engineering work
- Multiple solution approaches exist
- Cross-team collaboration is needed
- Significant architectural changes are involved
- Senior engineering input is valuable
- Consensus building is important

### **Skip the TDD When:**
- Solution is obvious and straightforward
- Simple bug fix or minor feature
- Document would just be implementation manual
- Rapid prototyping phase (use findings for TDD later)

## **Critical Success Factors**

### **Most Important Sections (in order)**
1. **Trade-offs and Design Decisions** - The heart of any good TDD
2. **Alternatives Considered** - Shows thorough thinking
3. **Goals and Non-Goals** - Prevents scope creep
4. **Context and Background** - Gets everyone aligned
5. **Cross-Cutting Concerns** - Addresses security, performance, etc.

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- Writing implementation manuals without design rationale
- Including too much low-level code or detailed schemas
- Making documents too long (>20 pages is usually too much)
- Writing after implementation (defeats the purpose)
- Letting documents become outdated after shipping

---

## **Tool Recommendations**

### **For Writing**
- **Google Docs** - Best for collaboration and commenting
- **Notion** - Good for structured documents with databases
- **Confluence** - Works well for enterprise environments
- **GitHub/GitLab** - Version control but harder collaboration

### **For Diagrams**
- **Lucidchart** - Professional system architecture diagrams
- **Draw.io** - Free, integrates with many platforms
- **Figma** - Good for UI mockups and user flows
- **Mermaid** - Code-based diagrams that version well

## **Quick Start Checklist**

### **Before You Start Writing:**
- [ ] Confirm the problem is complex enough to warrant a TDD
- [ ] Identify your target audience (developers, architects, stakeholders)
- [ ] Gather existing documentation and context
- [ ] Set up your collaboration tool and review process

### **While Writing:**
- [ ] Start with Context and Background section
- [ ] Define Goals and Non-Goals clearly
- [ ] Research alternatives and build prototypes if needed
- [ ] Focus heavily on trade-offs and design decisions
- [ ] Include diagrams and visual representations

### **During Review:**
- [ ] Share with close collaborators first for quick iteration
- [ ] Seek input from security, operations, and other cross-functional teams
- [ ] Address feedback on decisions and trade-offs, not just formatting
- [ ] Get formal approval from technical leads and stakeholders

### **After Implementation:**
- [ ] Update the document with lessons learned
- [ ] Review what you got right and wrong
- [ ] Use insights to improve future design documents
- [ ] Archive detailed implementation notes, keep architectural decisions
